the idea of shared package is to provide a way for the client to update the information it has through
table snapshots. The client will not do any direct actions, rather it will send
requests in the form of Messages. If server allows action and returns OK, TableSnapshot
will update clientside information.

Im writing this for my own good, so i dont forget. sometimes i forget to write stuff down.
