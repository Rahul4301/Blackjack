Create a multi-player blackjack gaming system. The system allows clients
to log in, add funds to their accounts, play games of blackjack with other
real players, or cash out their accounts. Standard rules apply. Cheating is
minimized. Play is fair.

This is a Java application with a GUI that operates over TCP/IP. This
system requires a server application and client application. There is no
web or HTML component. No databases, libraries, frameworks, or other
technologies may be used without approval.
